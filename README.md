## Plan on improving the project

Add your ideas here :

-   I would love to add a google maps link when hover on top of the address.
-   Add a special request text field in the reservation form, so people can add special ocasions or any other request like anniversary, birthday, etc.
-   It's important to add a link of the terms of use so people can read the terms.
